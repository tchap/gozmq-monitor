[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/tchap/gozmq-monitor.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tchap/gozmq-monitor)

Monitor combines gozmq.Socket.Monitor API call with gozmq-poller.Poller
and implements a channel-based API for receiving socket events.

# Installation

This is just yet another GitHub repository which you can directly import into
your project:
```go
import monitor "github.com/tchap/gozmq-monitor"
```
Do not forget to issue `go get` to download the package.

# Example

There is none for now, but check the tests to see how stuff works.

# Contributing

As all open source projects, we welcome any reasonable contributions,
particularly bug fixes :-) Since this project is rather small, it is
questionable if there is really anything to add. There is always some space for
improvements, though :-)

# License

See the `COPYING` file.
